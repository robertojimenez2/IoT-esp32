Developed a bi-directional IoT Telemetry System using C++ (ESP32) and web technologies. The system integrates ultrasonic and LDR sensors to log environmental data to a web dashboard, visualizing trends and statistics with a 45-second transmission interval. It also features remote actuator control, allowing users to trigger a buzzer and send text commands to a local OLED interface from the browser.
